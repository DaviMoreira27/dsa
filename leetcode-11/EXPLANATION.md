Given an integer input array `heights` representing the heights of vertical lines, write a function that returns the maximum area of water that can be contained by two of the lines (and the x-axis). The function should take in an array of integers and return an integer.

#          |  +  -  -  -  +  -  |
#          |  +  -  +  +  +  -  |  |
#          |  +  +  +  +  +  +  |  |
heights = [3, 4, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2]

OUTPUT: `21`
